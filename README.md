# Simple Blog Generation with Pandoc

Simple and effective Blog Generator with Pandoc. Can read yaml metadata from
headers and generate meta pages with `tags` and `categories` with corresponding
TOC. The LITE version can be rendered with a text based browser without JS
also.

A shinier React version will be added soon.
