`<h1 align="center">The Politician</h1>`{=html}

I'm too old to be watching TV (or web) series. I think too much. My mind
finds patterns in things which maybe aren't there and I feel there're many
powerful undercurrents to "The Politician" on Netflix which makes me love
it.

If you haven't heard of it yet, it's about this young man who's tried to
plot his course towards the US Presidency for as long as he can
remember. He's studied all the facets and requirements, he's traced
everything in common and he pursues his goal without qualms and seemingly
without a conscience.

Of course there are scandals and affairs but that's just details. But like
I said, there're undercurrents: His friends are his followers and
supporters who believe in him. They're moral relativists who act on
utilitarian principles. They believe that he will change the world for the
better and even he believes that, even though the path that they may take
may be cobbled with brutal and indignant acts.

He prefers to not feel and act in accordance to his objective. His human
side emerges once in a while and creates conflict. Of course there's
nothing new about that, but...

## The Future

Between this and Daybreakers; a story of the post apocalyptic world where
only teenagers have survived; a common theme of a lack of control over
one's destiny can be detected. We're all scared for the future, especially
those who're younger. There's a disconnect between the people who form the
largest voter blocs, that is, the middle aged and elderly; and the younger
ones, and the situation worsens everyday. It is evident not only with Greta
Thunberg against climate change or students rising up against gun violence
in the US, but even in seemingly unrelated tropes like the discord felt by
the millions of unemployed or underpaid young people across the developing
world (in my context: India). The future for them looks worse than it did
for us, bad enough as it is. Their lives are being stolen right out of
their pockets.

In that sense, both the series seek to speak to this discontent, with the
children reclaiming their destiny in the fictional world, and trying to
claim it in the physical one. In effect, their struggle for the future is
the struggle of their generation.

## The Heros that we Choose

When I was relatively young, I was fascinated by Lermontov's "A Hero of Our
Time". It depicted a morally bankrupt individual on the outside,
manipulating others just for fun. But there was evidence enough of his
hollow and fearful interior in the book, and how his acts were a
distraction not out of boredom but of true existential dread.

Lermontov wrote in the preface, that he bestowed the title not to exalt the
protagonist, but to emphasize that it was such individuals we were choosing
and worshiping. People who were good in looks, spoke well and could
influence and manipulate other people. Those were the ones we looked up to
and worshipped. That seems not to have changed in 170 years.

Payton's friends cling to him because he's their Hero. He's
photogenic/telegenic, he's smart and well spoken, and he has ambition. They
have chosen him just as well as countless others in the real world have
chosen theirs, all in a similar vein, to control their destiny through him
vicariously.

## The Fear and the Sadness

However, what really catches me beneath all of this is how afraid they all
are of not being meaningless. They could live ordinary lives with ordinary
events and simple instances of happiness, yet they long for something
more. They're all dreadfully afraid of being meaningless in the vast ocean
of time. What they really seek to do is leave a stamp on it somewhere,
which exclaims that they were there.

When they don't have that, they're sad, even when they feel they should be
happy. Even when things seem to be ok, there's an appreciation that there's
something missing in their lives. I just can't help sympathizing with that.

Or maybe I'm just projecting. Who knows!
